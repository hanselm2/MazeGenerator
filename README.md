Maze Generator
Author: Caleb Hanselman
Overview: A basic maze generator that uses dis-joint sets, a searching algorithm and a PNG class borrowed from a University Class that i had 
experience working with. Running the Makefile attached will create an executable called testsquaremaze, which will first draw a solvable maze of 
the dimensions specified in the main.cpp and then solve it using a DFS. The solution will be saved and drawn with a red line, and it will always seek the longest path. Two png's will be displayed titled "solved.png" and "unsolved.png". This was created because a Professor in class mentioned
this as a possible application of disjoint sets, and it seemed like a fun thing to make, plus stackoverflow had suggested this as a classic problem.

Credit goes to the author of the PNG and rgbapixel class. I only wrote the dsets and maze classes and reapproriated a Makefile template.
